"""Live latest-quote poller for held tickers.

Everything else in the system is pulled nightly (price *history*, dividends,
fundamentals, holders). The single number that needs to be fresh during the
session is the *current* price, so this module keeps a small in-process cache of
the latest quote per held ticker and refreshes it on a background thread every
~``interval`` seconds while the US market is open.

The cache is consumed by ``src.analytics.pnl._latest_two``: when a fresh quote
exists it overrides that ticker's spot price + previous close, so market value,
day change, weights and fund AUM all reflect the live price. Quotes older than
``_STALE`` (e.g. the poller died, or the market is closed) are ignored, so the
view falls back to the nightly DB close — never to a stale intraday number.

yfinance's freshest data is Yahoo's quote feed (``fast_info``), which is ~15 min
delayed for most US equities; polling faster than ~once a minute gains nothing
and risks rate-limiting, so the default cadence is 45s.
